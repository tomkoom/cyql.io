[cyql.io](https://cyql.io/) is a curated gallery of projects built on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).

It serves as a visual and functional directory for exploring the growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) powered by ICP. cyql.io highlights projects across categories like DeFi, NFTs, gaming, infrastructure, and more — all running natively on-chain.
